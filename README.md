## Usage
```
LOLDrivers-client.exe [OPTIONS]
 
Options:
  -m, --mode            Operating Mode {online, local, internal}
                            online = Download the newest driver set (default)
                            local = Use a local drivers.json file (requires '-f')
                            internal = Use the built-in driver set (can be outdated)

  -f, --driver-file     File path to 'drivers.json', when running in local mode

  -d, --scan-dir        Directory to scan for drivers (default: Windows driver folders)
                        Files which cannot be opened or read will be silently ignored

  -l, --scan-limit      Size limit for files to scan in MB (default: 10)
                        Be aware, higher values greatly increase runtime & CPU usage

  -s, --silent          Will only output found files for easy parsing (default: false)
  -j, --json            Format output as JSON (default: false)
